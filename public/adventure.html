    <div class="rhpp"><p style="padding: 5%;; font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;">Rishikesh is dotted with an abundance of tourist spots that are suitable for both leisure as well as religious tourists. When visiting this city, you can enjoy both high-octane action in the form of adventure sports as well as soulful moments of bliss in the form of temples and scenic beauty.The Ram Jhula and Lakshman Jhula were originally rudimentary jute-rope bridges that were constructed to honour the crossing of Lord Rama and his brother Lakshmanaâ€™s crossing of the Ganges on a mere jute rope. The 284 ft long Lakshman Jhula was tragically washed away in the flood of 1924, after which both the Ram Jhula and the Lakshman Jhule were re-built as modern iron suspension bridges.

        While the <br> <br> 1. Ram Jhula connects important tourist sites like Sivananda Ashram and Swargashram, the Lakshman Jhula connects the Pauri district with the Tehri district of Uttarakhand.
       <br>2. Neither of these bridges requires an entry fee and tourists are usually free to wander up and down the bridge to experience the breathtaking view of the mighty River Ganges.</p></div>

<div class="ladakhpp"><p style="padding: 5%;; font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;">The Land of High Passes, Ladakh, the newly created Union Territory in India (previously a part of Jammu & Kashmir), boasts a landscape that can leave you with your jaws dropped. It is a place where the landscape changes dramatically; it is truly astonishing to see the mountains, snow, cold desert, alpine meadows and lakes at a short distance from each other. Tourism in Ladakh is an absolute delight for nature lovers as well as adventurers.

    Adorned with the lofty barren mountains, Ladakh is home to some of the highest motorable passes like Khardung La (5359 m), Marsimik La (5582 m), and Chang La (5360 m), and alpine lakes like Pangong Tso (4350 m) and Tso Moriri (4522 m). Ladakh is further divided into three regions - Leh, Nubra, and Zanskar, and each region has several places to see.
    
    Ladakh is majorly popular amongst the adventurers who feel welcomed by the number of adrenaline rushing activities offered here. The union territory is amongst the top trekking destinations in India with amazing and unmatched treks like the popular Frozen River Trek/Chadar Trek. Ladakh also has opportunities for mountaineering, motor biking, mountain biking, white water rafting and more.</p></div>
